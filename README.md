Chicken Ticket is a Python powered blockchain solution. Users are encouraged to meander about the codebase, learn the nitty gritty details of what makes a coin tick, fork and design your own coin, or use as your every day cryptocurrency.

### Tech
Chicken Ticket uses a number of technologies:
* [Python 3] - A powerful object oriented programming language, we love it!
* [SQLite] - An ACID-compliant database solution for storing information in a single file, locally.
* [SQLAlchemy] - An ORM for SQL databases in Python.
* [PyCryptodomex] - Low-level cryptographic primitives for making the coin secure
* [ECDSA] - Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. Used for generating keys fast and securely.
